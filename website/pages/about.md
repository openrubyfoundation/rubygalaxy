### What makes our galaxy special

We are a monthly virtual meetup that allows Ruby developers of all skillsets to share their experience with the language. First time speakers are encouraged to come talk at our meetup!

Catch us every last Thursday of the month at 19:00 UTC on our [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/therubygalaxy) channel 🌌
