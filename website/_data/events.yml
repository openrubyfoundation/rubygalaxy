    - name: Setup Ruby for GitHub Actions and MySpace
      abstract: DevOps goals have stayed the same over the year, but our tools, infrastructure, and operating models have changed. To support modern software delivery, organizations must establish and share proven developer workflows. This talk will focus on building an automated README with GitHub Actions. Plan to leave this talk with ideas on how you can automate new portions of your software development workflows, outside of CI/CD.
      author: Brian Douglas
      author_bio: Brian Douglas is a Developer Advocate at GitHub where he works on increasing use of the GitHubâ€™s platform specific features (Ask him about GitHub Actions!) through technical content distributed on the internet. In addition to that, Brian has a passion open source and loves mentoring new contributors.

    - name: JSON Web Tokens and Decentralized Identity - What Ruby Developers Need To Know
      abstract: JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) provide verifiable identity in distributed systems and are usually generated by centralized identity providers. Iâ€™ll walk though how JWTs solve the decentralized identity problem for Ruby devs. Learn about JWT structure, how to use them and mistakes to avoid.
